Day 0: March 1, 2018

Today's Progress: 30 days of javascript (JS Drum Kit, CSS + JS Clock, CSS Variables and JS, Array methods), Installed Hugo locally // still have to install into wilsonusman.me

Thoughts: I still feel like I need to practice more array method examples and create my own. I also need to understand how Hugo really works before I commit to using it on my portfolio.
