Day 0: March 31, 2018

Today's Progress: 30 days of javascript (30DJS) (JS Drum Kit, CSS + JS Clock, CSS Variables and JS, Array methods), Installed Hugo locally // still have to install into wilsonusman.me

Thoughts: I still feel like I need to practice more array method examples and create my own. I also need to understand how Hugo really works before I commit to using it on my portfolio.

Day 1: Abril 1, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued the 30DJS course where we practiced some flexbox and css transitioning. In the next tutorial we practiced more JS where I got to build a few vanilla JS functions to live search a database using fetch(), RegExp, .filter, .json and some other cool methods.

Thoughts: It's pretty easy to follow along the course, but when you have to think from scratch how to build these functions it's pretty hard. I feel like if I wasn't following along it wont take me hours to build these functions.

Day 2: Abril 2, 2018

Today's Progress: Built a drawing app using HTML5 Canvas, and created a checklist and built a function that allows you to select multiple items by using the shiftKey.

Thoughts: It's amazing the things you can do with all the tools and resources already available online for you. To put it in perspective you can build a drawing app in just 50 lines of JS, and 30 lines for the multiple select function. ðŸ¤¯
