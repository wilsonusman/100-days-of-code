Day 1: March 31, 2018

Today's Progress: 30 days of javascript (30DJS) (JS Drum Kit, CSS + JS Clock, CSS Variables and JS, Array methods), Installed Hugo locally // still have to install into wilsonusman.me

Thoughts: I still feel like I need to practice more array method examples and create my own. I also need to understand how Hugo really works before I commit to using it on my portfolio.

Day 2: April 1, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued the 30DJS course where we practiced some flexbox and css transitioning. In the next tutorial we practiced more JS where I got to build a few vanilla JS functions to live search a database using fetch(), RegExp, .filter, .json and some other cool methods.

Thoughts: It's pretty easy to follow along the course, but when you have to think from scratch how to build these functions it's pretty hard. I feel like if I wasn't following along it wont take me hours to build these functions.

Day 3: April 2, 2018

Today's Progress: Built a drawing app using HTML5 Canvas, and created a checklist and built a function that allows you to select multiple items by using the shiftKey.

Thoughts: It's amazing the things you can do with all the tools and resources already available online for you. To put it in perspective you can build a drawing app in just 50 lines of JS, and 30 lines for the multiple select function. ðŸ¤¯

Day 4: April 3, 2018

Today's Progress: Styled an HTML5 video player and and programmed all the functions (play, pause, fast forward, reverse, fullscreen, etc...) It's so rewarding to see that all this stuff is possible with a little thinking and practice.

Another part of my time was spent learning some Dev Tools tricks and JavaScript referencing and copying arrays and objects.

Lastly, I put together a key sequence detection AKA KONAMI code web page.

Thoughts: Hmmmm.... Yea JavaScript math is a bit of a challenge. Also I think I need to read more about deep clone and deep copy, and definitely *this* keyword.

Day 5: April 4, 2018

Today's Progress: Practiced with MouseEvents to add shadows.

Thoughts: I need to spend more time practicing math algorithms and applying it to JS.

Day 6: April 5, 2018

  Today's Progress: Wrote a function to sort an Array and strip articles from the Array.

Thoughts: Although this might be easier to do in jQuery, I like to know what the vanilla JS is doing behind the scenes and have more context.

Day 7: April 6, 2018

  Today's Progress: Used the map, reduce, and from methods to get a node list time information and add it up to get the total Video time, in seconds and hours.

Thoughts: I'm having trouble thinking about how I would do this myself without the tutorial, but I can't seem to have the intuition yet for programming these functions on my own.

Day 8 - 12, 2018

  Last few days progress: I've obviously been slacking at posting my progress. You can find all the work I've done on the projects page on my site.

Thoughts: I think my chops are beginning to improve. As I practice more and more Javascript it starts becoming a bit easier. I still struggle with problem solving through some of the solutions without any research or tutorial :/
